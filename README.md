### Ethereum-based lottery

Simple app featuring solidity smart contracts and mocha testing, with thanks to Stephen Grider's excellent course at Udemy.

Lottery app that registers a manager, players, and funds to be contributed and won. MetaMask, the Rinkeby test network, Remix, Infura and Etherscan.

The smart contact logic resides in Lottery.sol and the lottery-react folder contains the React front end. 

To download and run locally, clone this repo and copy and paste the Lottery.sol into the playground at https://remix.ethereum.org.

You'll need to set up a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) account and get some (free) test funds from http://faucet.rinkeby.io/.
